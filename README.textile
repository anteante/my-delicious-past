h1. My Delicious Past

This Chrome extension helps you reminisce about all the bookmarks that you saved using Delicious.
Every day, this extension will show you bookmarks that have the same date.
For example, if you're using Chrome on December 17, 2010, 
the extension will show you bookmarks from December 17 of 2009, 2008, and so on.

The rumor that Yahoo is closing Delicious inspired me to make this extension.
However, it doesn't look like it's not going to happen. Regardless,
I hope this extension helps you reconnect with your past bookmarks.
